## About Me Section

### Introduction
Hey there! I'm Anurag—a developer who believes that exceptional mobile apps have the power to transform how we live, work, and connect. My journey in tech isn't just about writing code; it's about crafting experiences that feel natural, perform flawlessly, and solve real problems.

### What Drives Me
I thrive on challenges that make other developers nervous. Upgrading a production React Native app from version 0.72 to 0.78 while squashing 95% of critical bugs? That's the kind of puzzle that gets my adrenaline pumping. I don't just fix things—I make them better, faster, and more elegant.

### My Philosophy
Mobile development is where artistry meets engineering. Every animation matters. Every millisecond counts. Every user interaction is an opportunity to delight. I approach each project with obsessive attention to detail, whether I'm architecting a complex navigation system or fine-tuning a single component's performance.

### Professional Journey
From my early days at OTTDock, where I revolutionized responsive web layouts and accelerated content publishing workflows, to my current role at AppWizards, I've consistently delivered solutions that exceed expectations. I've worked across multiple client projects, each with unique challenges—from file upload systems to intricate UI component libraries—building a diverse skill set that makes me versatile and reliable.

### What Makes Me Different
- **Battle-Tested Expertise**: I've shipped real applications to real users on both iOS and Android app stores
- **Legacy Code Whisperer**: I can take aging, buggy codebases and transform them into modern, maintainable masterpieces
- **Performance Obsessive**: I optimize every render, minimize every bundle, and perfect every interaction
- **Design-First Mindset**: I bridge the gap between Figma mockups and pixel-perfect implementations
- **Continuous Learner**: Technology evolves daily, and so do I—always exploring cutting-edge patterns and tools

## Professional Experience Highlights

### Current Role: React Native Junior Developer at AppWizards
**April 2025 - Present | Indore, India**

At AppWizards, I'm not just writing code—I'm solving business problems through technology. Here's what I bring to the table every day:

- **Multi-Client Project Leadership**: Currently building production applications for diverse clients, each with unique requirements ranging from e-commerce platforms to social networking features. I handle everything from initial architecture decisions to final App Store submissions.

- **Legacy Modernization Expert**: Successfully led a critical upgrade project, migrating a client's production app from React Native 0.72 to 0.78. This wasn't just a version bump—it involved refactoring deprecated APIs, resolving breaking changes, and fixing approximately 95% of existing bugs, resulting in a more stable, performant application.

- **Cross-Platform Delivery**: Every app I build works flawlessly on both iOS and Android, maintaining platform-specific design guidelines while maximizing code reuse. Users can't tell they're using a cross-platform app—that's the mark of quality.

- **Scalable Architecture**: I design component libraries and navigation systems that grow with the business, making future features easier to implement and maintain.

### Foundation: React Native Intern at AppWizards
**December 2024 - April 2025 | Indore, India**

My internship was an intensive bootcamp where I transformed from a frontend developer into a mobile development specialist:

- **Rapid Multi-Project Contribution**: Worked across three different production projects simultaneously, adapting to different codebases, team dynamics, and client requirements. This experience taught me versatility and the ability to context-switch effectively.

- **UI Component Mastery**: Built complex, reusable UI components including custom file upload modals, screen navigation systems, and interactive elements that became standard across multiple projects.

- **Version Upgrade Initiative**: Took ownership of the challenging React Native 0.72 to 0.78 upgrade, demonstrating initiative beyond typical intern responsibilities. This project taught me deep internals of React Native and how to handle breaking changes systematically.

- **Collaborative Growth**: Participated in code reviews, pair programming sessions, and knowledge-sharing meetings that accelerated my learning curve exponentially.

### Previous: Frontend Developer at OTTDock
**October 2022 - June 2023**

Where I first fell in love with creating exceptional digital experiences:

- **Responsive Design Revolution**: Redesigned and implemented mobile-first layouts across the platform, resulting in significant increases in mobile traffic and user engagement. Every pixel was intentional, every breakpoint carefully considered.

- **CMS Transformation**: Completely revamped the content management system's creation workflow, dramatically improving the speed at which content creators could publish articles, videos, and media. This wasn't just about UI—it required rethinking the entire user journey.

- **Client Website Excellence**: Managed and optimized multiple client websites, focusing on performance metrics like load times, Core Web Vitals, and smooth interactions. Implemented lazy loading, image optimization, and code splitting strategies.

- **User Experience Innovation**: Introduced modern animation patterns and micro-interactions that elevated the overall feel of the platform, making it more engaging without sacrificing performance.

### Early Days: Frontend Developer Intern at OTTDock
**August 2022 - October 2022**

Where the journey began:

- **Foundation Building**: Maintained critical UI components across the platform, learning the importance of consistency and attention to detail.
- **Problem Solving**: Diagnosed and resolved layout issues, particularly non-responsive elements that broke on certain devices.
- **Animation & Delight**: Implemented CSS transitions and JavaScript animations that enhanced user experience without overwhelming the interface.

## What I'm Passionate About

### Performance as a Feature
I treat performance like a core feature, not an afterthought. Every component I build is profiled. Every list is optimized. Every image is compressed. Users don't wait for my apps—they enjoy using them.

### User-Centric Design
Technology should serve people, not confuse them. I obsess over user flows, ensuring every tap makes sense, every screen transition feels natural, and every feature is discoverable.

### Clean, Maintainable Code
Future developers (including future me) will thank present me for writing code that's clear, well-documented, and follows best practices. I believe in code that tells a story.

### Continuous Innovation
The mobile landscape evolves rapidly. I stay ahead by experimenting with new libraries, studying emerging patterns, and contributing to open-source projects when possible.

### Solving Real Problems
The best projects are those that make someone's life easier, business more efficient, or experience more delightful. I'm driven by impact, not just implementation.

## My Approach to Development

### Discovery & Planning
Before writing a single line of code, I invest time understanding the problem deeply. What are the user pain points? What are the technical constraints? What does success look like?

### Design Collaboration
I work closely with designers to ensure what we build is both beautiful and buildable. I push back when designs aren't technically feasible and suggest alternatives that maintain the vision while being practical.

### Iterative Development
I ship early, ship often, and iterate based on feedback. MVPs allow us to validate assumptions before investing heavily in features that might not resonate.

### Quality Assurance
Testing isn't optional—it's integral. From unit tests to manual QA across devices, I ensure quality at every step.

### Documentation & Handoff
I document my work thoroughly, making it easy for others to understand, maintain, and extend what I've built.
